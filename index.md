## Installation

To install the `stats-strided-dmeanvar` package, you can use npm. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install stats-strided-dmeanvar
```

This command will download the package and its dependencies, making it easy to integrate into your project.

## Usage

After installation, you can use the package in your JavaScript code. Here‚Äôs a basic example:

```javascript
const { dmean, dvariance } = require('stats-strided-dmeanvar');

const data = new Float64Array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]);
const stride = 1; // Use every element in the array

const mean = dmean(data, stride);
const variance = dvariance(data, stride);

console.log(`Mean: ${mean}`);
console.log(`Variance: ${variance}`);
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to calculate the mean and variance of a simple array. Adjust the `stride` parameter as needed for your specific use case.

## API Documentation

### `dmean(data, stride)`

Calculates the arithmetic mean of a strided array.

- **Parameters**:
  - `data`: A Float64Array containing the data points.
  - `stride`: The step size between elements to include in the calculation.

- **Returns**: The mean of the selected elements.

### `dvariance(data, stride)`

Calculates the sample variance of a strided array.

- **Parameters**:
  - `data`: A Float64Array containing the data points.
  - `stride`: The step size between elements to include in the calculation.

- **Returns**: The sample variance of the selected elements.

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Mean and Variance Calculation

```javascript
const { dmean, dvariance } = require('stats-strided-dmeanvar');

const data = new Float64Array([10.0, 20.0, 30.0, 40.0, 50.0]);
const stride = 1;

const mean = dmean(data, stride);
const variance = dvariance(data, stride);

console.log(`Mean: ${mean}`); // Output: Mean: 30
console.log(`Variance: ${variance}`); // Output: Variance: 250
```

### Example 2: Using Stride

```javascript
const { dmean, dvariance } = require('stats-strided-dmeanvar');

const data = new Float64Array([1.0, 3.0, 5.0, 7.0, 9.0]);
const stride = 2; // Use every second element

const mean = dmean(data, stride);
const variance = dvariance(data, stride);

console.log(`Mean: ${mean}`); // Output: Mean: 5
console.log(`Variance: ${variance}`); // Output: Variance: 8
```
